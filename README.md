# MPA-simulation
 Example code and data to run the simulation described in the Ecoological Applications paper (reference to be updated here on publication).
 
 Note that the code and data is for one example MPA and reference site pair only (Bodega Head). Code will need to be modified for use at other sites. Also, output covarite estimates and spatial parameters from the spatial model are provided for use here. We provide code that uses all covariate parameter estimates rather than just the significant parameters. We have not provided the code for the spatial model.
 
 The code has been tested, but may need updating or further modification.
 
 Data files for the other sites used in the paper are also provided.
 
 For any questions regarding the data or the code, please contact Nick Perkins: Nicholas.Perkins@utas.edu.au
